## Imperative API

All bluetooth operations are provided using a event driven and functional programming paradigm approach, in this paradigm we avoid persisting state and mutate it.

  ```bash
    import {turnOnBluetoothIfPossible, turnOffBluetoothIfPossible, onDiscovery, onStateChange} from 'react-native-bluetooth-le';

    turnOnBluetoothIfPossible(); // The bluetooth adapter was turned on.
    turnOffBluetoothIfPossible(); // The bluetooth adapter was turned off.

    /** Listen for bluetooth power state change */
    const unsubscribe = onStateChange(({status})=>{
      console.log(status); // "on" or "off"
    })

    // Later when does not need to listen this event anymore...
    unsubscribe();


    /** Listen bluetooth discovery event  */
    const unsubscribe = onDiscovery((device)=>{
      console.log(device);
    })

    // Later when does not need to listen this event anymore...
    unsubscribe();
  ```

export default ({children}) => <div className='prose'>{children}</div>
