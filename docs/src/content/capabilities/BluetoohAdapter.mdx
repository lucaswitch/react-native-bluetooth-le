#### Whether bluetooth adapter is enabled

```js
  import {getIsEnabled} from 'react-native-bluetooth-le';

  getIsEnabled(); // "on" or "off"

```

#### Gets whether bluetooth adapter has low energy support

```js
  import {getIsSupported} from 'react-native-bluetooth-le';

  getIsSupported(); // true or false, true if is current device supports bluetooth low energy operations.
```

#### Gets bluetooth adapter name and address

For the user security, make sure to ask the user common bluetooth permissions.

```js
  import {getName, getAddress} from 'react-native-bluetooth-le';

  getName(); // "Samsung S21..."
  getAddress(); // "00:00:00:00:21" Mac address for Android and UUID for some most recent IOS versions.
```

#### Gets whether location is enabled

In some operations it's necessary to access user location. To know if user already authorized location fetching use the following method:

```js
  import {getIsLocationEnabled} from 'react-native-bluetooth-le';

  getIsLocationEnabled(); // "on" or "off"

```

#### Listen to bluetooth adapter sudden state change

In some operations it's necessary to access user location. To know if user already authorized location fetching use the following method:

```js
  import {onStateChange} from 'react-native-bluetooth-le';

  const unsubscribe = onStateChange(({status})=>{
    console.log(status): // "on" or "off"
  });

  // Make sure to "unsubscribe" this event later to avoid listen unnecessary state changes.

  unsubscribe(); // Remove registered listener.
```

#### Listen bluetooth discovery and find nearby devices

Starts to listen nearby devices using "bluetooth scan".
Make sure to enable this functionality on your app for a small period of time since it's consumes too much battery.
Android Notes:
Make sure to ask the user to enable location since bluetooth scan operations can expose user location to nearby devices.
```js
  import {onDiscovery} from 'react-native-bluetooth-le';


  const unsubscribe = onDiscovery((devices = [])=>{
     console.log(devices); // This devices is filtered by it's mac address and never will be sent repeated.
  });

  // Make sure to "unsubscribe" this event later to avoid listen discovery.
  unsubscribe(); // Remove registered listener.
```
